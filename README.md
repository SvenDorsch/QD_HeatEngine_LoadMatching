# Load matching for QD heat engines

The notebook included in this repository provides a simple, yet versatile model to match the load resistor to a QD heat engine in an experimental setup. The model is constructred using [QmeQ](https://github.com/gedaskir/qmeq). Input parameters are limited to the saturation current and are purposefully kept simple and easy to identify in initial characterization measurements.
